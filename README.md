# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview

In this section, we performed customer segmentation analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm on a dataset containing information about customers, specifically their 'Age' and 'Spending Score (1-100)'. The goal was to identify patterns and groups within the customer base to gain insights into their spending behaviors.

## Conclusion

The customer segmentation analysis provides valuable insights into distinct customer groups based on income, age, and spending behavior. These insights can inform targeted marketing strategies, personalized customer experiences, and product/service offerings.
